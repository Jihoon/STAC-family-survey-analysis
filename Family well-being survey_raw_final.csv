Could STAC/IIASA organise holiday camps in the summer with external staff caring for the kids? For instance ""kids science week"" or a ""tennis and sports camp"" for kids of IIASA employees (at least school age kids).  Schlosspark, swimming places and tennis court offers great oportunities for such programme and it would bring IIASA kids together. ","Working culture at IIASA is stil, to a large extent, enhancing old-fashioned stereotypes, expecting mothers automatically to be working part-time, admin positions are filled with women, lead positions are filled with male candidates. Working on full-time basis is still considered to equal with ""sitting in the office until 18"".  Women, whose partners are working full time, are found to be on part-time basis without a question. Countering such stereotypes requires attention, but also clear actions. It is not fully recognised that part-timers (mostly women with small kids) use their working hours extremely efficiently, while at the same time get only paid for the part-time share. Often the workload is not adjusted, so compensation is done by working from home, during holidays, reply emails during ""off hours etc. Efficiency, keeping within deadlines, low numbers of sick-leave and bringing results should be part of the salary considerations, not just the hours spent in the office. Also part-timers should have the same opportunity for salary adjustments as everyone else and should be fully appreciated for their share of work. Introducing a technical devise (electronic keys) would be simple and easy for tracking working hours, and would allow employees flexibility with  of plus/minus hours."

This is in stark contrast to when I joined IIASA in 2005 with a two year old and pregnant wife (e.g. no paternity leave, no info on Familienbeihilfe - I actually discovered 3 years later that we were eligible for this). Many of these improvements have focused on young children, and I think this is great. However, I would like you to consider some improvements for families with older children in the interest of equity between families. My suggestion would be to extend the education grant to cover university education (many international organizations do this). Recently more and more universities are charging tuition fees and this is likely to increase. Further when IIASA's education grant policy was set, very few universities charged fees. I would certainly consider changing employer for one that contributes to uni fees when my children become 18. "

For dual career couples with small children 5 sick days per year (10 days per year for two persons) is simply impossible as small children are sick and required to stay out of kindergarten much more often. It was a shock for us, since in Sweden where we came from you have up to 60 days per child per year that you can take to care for them when they are sick. Most people will of course not need that many days, but 5 sick days in total is just impossible! Somehow and with a lot of stress and sometimes having grandparents flown in (and my husband being asked by his employer if he doesn't have a wife!), we did manage. I would however wish for my younger colleagues with small children that some of that (unnecessary) stress is taken away for them and that they can stay home with children that are sick and have the possibility to work more often from home when required. It seems to me that the current (maybe it has now changed?) system is set up for a time when men went to work and women stayed home full-time with children. But if we want more women to have careers the system and its rules must also allow for it.    ","See my previous answers."

These families are in a very difficult situation, and IIASA would like professionals to move here for a year, which makes it very hard to adapt with a child, and hard to have help especially within a few months or a year. The grandparents are far away, it is very hard to find a good babysitter, and anyway it is not good for the child, nor for the parent that somebody else takes care of the child when he/she is sick. This should be better respected. 4) Give parental leave opportunities, as in the EU institutions. One could get few weeks (in the EU it is 6 months...) that can be taken and used for travelling home, or just spending enough time with the kids. These leaves are normally not paid, or only at a very low salary (e.g. 400 euro per month), but the position is kept and extended. 5) Finally, it is not possible to live a relaxed life with 6 months-1 year contract. One needs to have children inscribed in kindergardens in Vienna at leat 1-2-3 years in advance!! But we do not know if we are here next year. 6) Connected to the 5th point, a much stronger assistance in administration would be needed. E.g. one needs to arrange the family benefits already at the beginning, but this could be managed by IIASA, either HR or a peer group.",""

There are cultural differences, but also we simply don't understand what are their habits with kids e.g. we go to the park, and we can't find many children. We don't speak properly the language and this turns into a barrier when trying to meet other parents at the kindergarten. We don't leave in Vienna, and I have the impression that Austrians living in Modling and Laxenburg is more conservative and perhaps less open to ""foreign"". 
We also struggle to find nice things to do with kids (activities, events, etc.) because we are not that fluent in German to spot always where and what to do.

A family club at IIASA might be a good idea. Or maybe that some of the existing clubs, develop activities which are child-inclusive. I would love to go hiking, skiing, skating, or do gardening  with my IIASA fellows in ways that I can bring my family and specially my children in. 

I ma not sure how this could work, but I have the feeling that a lot of the partners from IIASA staff that move to Austria struggle to settle down, specially of they don't' have a job and don't speak the language.

At least in Vienna, it is very difficult to find childcare for infants before one year. I realize that employees (especially mothers) can take a significant amount of time off, but not everyone might want to take all the offered time. Having an onsite daycare that takes infants at 3 months or 6 months could help women who want to come back to work earlier.
